Really simple [Python 3.6.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/) quantum programming demonstration using the great [QISKit](https://github.com/QISKit/qiskit-sdk-py):

To install dependencies into a Python `virtual environment`:
```bash
    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    $ python -m venv ENV_QUANTUM
    $ source ENV_QUANTUM/Scripts/activate
```

Then, after activating the selected environment:
```bash
   $ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
